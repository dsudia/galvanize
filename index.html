  <h1>Cities I've Lived In</h1>
  <p>I was born in Oakland. When I was three, my mother moved to Lafayette and my dad followed her. As a teenager my family moved to Pleasanton. When I moved out on my own I moved to Alameda, and then to Walnut Creek when I met my wife. My wife and I moved to Oakland, then Phoenix, Boulder and finally Denver, where we live now.</p>

  <h1>Cities I Want to Visit</h1>
  <p>I would love to visit London because of the rich history there. I've always wanted to visit Berlin to immerse myself in the culture and see real-world examples of Bauhaus. Finally, New York just seems like an insanely busy city, and I just want to experience that.</p>
